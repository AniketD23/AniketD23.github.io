I am a first-year Ph.D. student Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign advised by Professor Saugata Ghose. My research interests are in computer architecture, specifically in memory and storage systems as well as sustainable computing. I received my B.S. (also at Illinois!) in Computer Science and Philosophy.
